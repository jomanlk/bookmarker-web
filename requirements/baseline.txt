- You are creating the web frontend for a bookmarking API. The bookmarking API allows you to create and list bookmarks.
- The frontend application will be made using vuejs and tailwindcss
- All configuration values should be stored in an .env file. Any time a key and value is added to the .env file it should be added to an .env.example file as only the key
- The API host for the bookmarker service is available via the API_HOST env value
- The bookmark API allows me to store bookmarks. A bookmark consists of an id (auto generated), title, description, thumbnail, URL. Meta data in the form of created_at and updated_at are also there
- This web application will allow you to create, search and manage my bookmarks
- Separate concerns. Don't mix UI and API server calls. Vue view components should just manage the UI, have a service to communicate with the API
- Use Axios for API requests
- This is the API response given by the GET /bookmarks API endpoint, which returns a list of the saved bookmarks
